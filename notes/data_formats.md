# Midi -files

Music Instrument Digital Interface, or MIDI provides an easy approach as it provides "instructions" over actual audio. Also occupies very little memory.

In the first attempt I've included in the repository, we've used the music21 python-library from MIT to read MIDI data.

## Investigate

I'll try to leave a tiny chapter detailing where I should look for next when working on this topic.

- Alternative options over using mids
- Conversion of music to mid format in a persisting fashion
- Tools to work with MIDI-files.
