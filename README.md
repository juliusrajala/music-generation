# {AI Tunes} projects

This project folder is for me to collect learnings about creating music using deep learning.

**first_attempt/** contains a Jupyter notebook built following a blogpost.


## Purpose of this repository

I'm attempting to use this github-repository as a kind of an open journal for investigating music-generation. It's possible that the stuff here could be of use to someone else at one point.

Equally, this should provide me with the option of looking back at possible progress and beginning of this project.
